# Matatu Saccos lost/found items system
This is a system I built of Matatu Saccos in Kenya allowing Sacco agents to upload items surrendered in their respective branches by other travellers, uploading them to the System and hopefully connecting the lost item to it's owner through descriptionmatching by the system once a person reports a lost item
